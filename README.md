# SitcomChooser
The code is used to randomly select the sitcom episode and play it on vlc app. The code was programmed on mac for mac system.

I have couple of nice sitcoms, my favorites. I have already watched them once. However I still keep watching them but unlike first time 
when I watched sequentially, now i chose the episodes randomly. The problem was i ended up choosing same espisode more than once.

Hence I decided to write a python script to randomly select the episodes so that once I have watched the episode I dont watch it again unless
i completely watch the seasons.
